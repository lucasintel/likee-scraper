## Disclaimer

This app is in no way affiliated with, authorized, maintained or endorsed by
Likee or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries.

This is purely an educational proof of concept.

## Installation

### Pre-built - Recommended

Just download the latest release for your platform [here](https://github.com/kandayo/likee-scraper/releases).

Then move the binary to your PATH, or just use it right away.

### From source

It only takes a few seconds to compile it yourself. It's not rocket science.

Build dependencies:
 - Crystal language, https://crystal-lang.org/install.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kandayo/likee-scraper
$ cd likee-scraper
$ shards build --release --ignore-crystal-version
$ ./bin/likeer --help
```

Then move the binary to your PATH, or just use it right away.

## Usage

For more examples, please refer to the [**documentation**](https://absolab.xyz/likee-scraper).

### Download profile by @username

Looking up a user by username requires an additional API request. It's strongly
recommended to use User IDs instead. Usernames must be prefixed with an `@`.

```bash
$ likeer -u @username1 -u @username2 [...]
```

### Download profile by User ID

If a identifier does not have a prefix, it is assumed to be an User ID.

```bash
$ likeer -u 11111111
```

### Batch file

If `--batch-file <file.txt>` (or `-a`) is given, Likee will read *file.txt*
expecting @usernames and User IDs to download, one identifier per line.
Lines starting with an `#` or empty lines are considered as comments and
ignored.

Usernames must be prefixed with an `@`, e.g. `@username`.

IDs must not be prefixed with an `@`, e.g. `1111111`.

```bash
$ cat batch.txt
~> # Comment (ignored)
~> @username   # Inline comments are also allowed.
~> 111111111

$ likeer -a batch.txt
```

### Fast update

If `--fast-update` (or `-f`) is given, Likeer stops when arriving at the
first already downloaded video. This flag is recommended when you use Likeer
to update your personal archive.

This concept was inspired by Instaloader.

```
$ likeer -f -u @username

Downloading 1 profile: @username.

Collecting videos from profile @username.
 + Example Username - 000003.mp4 [========================] 11.1 MB | 100%
 + Example Username - 000002.mp4; exists
✅ Example Username in sync!
```
